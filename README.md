# 1430 Group Projects

Assorted group projects completed for COSC1430 at the University of Houston.

## Group Assignment One
Read from and output to a txt file in c++. Data from the file processed using structs.

## Group Assignment Two
Implement rudimentary polymorphism with c++. Use of `pure virtual` function to make a c++ abstract class, `animal`. Use of `static` integer to keep track of how many of each class is being created.

## Java Homework Example
Basic file input and output in java. Reading in data from a CSV, separating and processing before spitting it back out to the user. Use of `Scanner` and `BufferedReader` classes for input handling.

## Tic Tac Toe
This was an in-class project. Tic Tac Toe in C++ using the console. The player gets to choose x's or o's and the computer makes random moves so if you lose you must really not be trying.

## Tetris in Java Final Project
Uses the `swing` library to create a java applet where the user can play Tetris. For piece rotation, I chose to use matrix multiplication learned from linear algebra to come up with an algorithm that would rotate each piece subclass without hardcoding.
